# NNMOF

Nueral Network boosted Moment of Fluid


## Note:

(1) Only support one ghost cell layer.
    For MPI exchange, always 0 and n(i+1) as halo nodes.
    For centered variable, 0 and n(i+1) are boundary nodes.
    For face variable, 0 and n(i) are boundary nodes.

(2) Execute with command

    mpirun -np (X) (executable) (input)

-   (X) should be consistant with px\*py in input file

-   (executable) is generated by Makefile

-   (input) is the name of the input namelist file, without suffix .namelis
    for example, for file test3.namelist, the (input) should be test3.
    If no (input) is given, it will search for the default input file input.namelist.

(3) Only HDF5 is supported for input and output field files.
